            <h3>What is defi?</h3>
            <p>Defi is short for decentralized finance. The ethereum blockchain houses code that powers dApps (decentralized applications). These dApps have various functionality based on their code. Users of dApps access decentralized services on the blockchain in a permissionless manner.</p>
            <p>Types of dApps include:</p>
            <ul class="defi-ul">
                <li>decentralized exchanges</li>
                <li>lending protocols</li>
                <li>yield aggregators</li>
                <li>marketplaces</li>

          <h3>What is <a target="_blank" href="https://makerdao.com/en/">MakerDAO</a>?</h3>
          <p>MakerDAO is a lending and borrowing protocol.</p>
          <p>By depositing ethereum, users are able to borrow <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dai">$DAI</a>.  DAI is a stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar.  With borrowed DAI, users are able to use it the same way fiat currency would be used.</p>
          <p>Users have to keep track of ethereum price as a level of collateral must be maintained.  If the price of ethereum falls too far, part of the ethereum collateral will be liquidated unless the DAI loan is repaid.</p>
          <code>deposit eth => borrow dai => maintain collateral</code>
          <p>Users can also acquire the Maker token.  The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/maker">$MKR</a> token gives holders governance rights allowing for votes on proposals involving the protocol.</p>
